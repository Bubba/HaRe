-------------------------

refacFunDef : fails 1 of 20
  - Test20.hs input file is not well formed, GHC complains

fromConcreteToAbstract : fails 1 of 1
  - compound refactoring, must come back to it

duplication : fails 1 of 12
  - side condition test faulty, the refactoring should not be
   attempted.
   If it is done, results in GHC complaining about duplicate def for h
   and t


foldPatterns : fails 1 of 6
  - The SimpleIn1_TokOut.hs expected result file seems wrong 

asPatterns : fails 2 of 27
  - A6: parentheses arranged differently in result.
        Note: file is not a valid haskell module
  - E3: HaRe is given the target site, not definition. Does not
        introduce it at the right point

generaliseDef : fails 2 of 17
  Sum2: replaces (+) with (c) instead of c
  FunIn7: side condition testing fails, should not attempt refactor


refacDataNewType : failed 2 of 5
  - seems to be unimplemented, or partially implemented
    Getting an "Unrecognised arguments" exception from the refactorer

unfoldDef : fails 2 of 19
  - Seems to be an error in the complex patterns

unfoldAsPatterns : fails 7 of 35
  - seems to be a parsing error, does not recognise as pattern

refacRedunDec : passes 17 of 17
  - Note: I am sure Test1_tokOut.hs is wrong, the meaning is changed

letToWhere : fails 7 of 15
  - MultiMatchesIn4: invalid initial file
  - MultiMatchesIn5: invalid initial file
  - MultiMatchesIn6: invalid initial file

refacSlicing : fails 1 of 23
  - Test11 produces incorrect result

liftOneLevel : fails 1 of 14
  - fails to test precondition properly and does refactor it should not

---

pointwiseToPointfree : failed 7 of 7
demote : fails 7 of 161
introNewDef : fails 13 of 15
liftToToplevel : fails 13 of 14
evalMonad : fails 14 of 19
introCase : fails 22 of 33
subIntroPattern : fails 22 of 25
addCon - fails 4 of 12
evalAddEvalMon : fails : Prelude.read: no parse
evalAddEvalMonCache: fails : Prelude.read: no parse
introThreshold : fails Prelude.read: no parse [problem is UTest.data
   set up for caching test, but script does not call it]
merging : fails Prelude.read: no parse
