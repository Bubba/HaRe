Test directories
----------------

Passes
------

addField - passes, and works in emacs
addOneParameter - passes, and works in emacs
cleanImports : passes
foldDef : passes
generativeFold: passes
instantiate : passes
introPattern : passes
removeDef : passes 17 of 17 
renaming : passes 28 of 28
rmOneParameter : passes 10 of 10


removeCon : fails 1 of 20 - seems to be a whitespace issue in the
   generated diff.

refacFunDef : fails 1 of 20
  - Test20.hs input file is not well formed, GHC complains

fromConcreteToAbstract : fails 1 of 1
  - compound refactoring, must come back to it

duplication : fails 1 of 12
  - side condition test faulty, the refactoring should not be
   attempted.
   If it is done, results in GHC complaining about duplicate def for h
   and t

whereToLet : fails 1 of 10
  - whitespace issue, blank lines

foldPatterns : fails 1 of 6
  - The SimpleIn1_TokOut.hs expected result file seems wrong 

asPatterns : fails 2 of 27
  - A6: parentheses arranged differently in result.
        Note: file is not a valid haskell module
  - E3: HaRe is given the target site, not definition. Does not
        introduce it at the right point

generaliseDef : fails 2 of 17
  Sum2: replaces (+) with (c) instead of c
  FunIn7: side condition testing fails, should not attempt refactor

refacDataNewType : failed 2 of 5
rmFromExport : fails 2 of 3
unfoldDef : fails 3 of 19
mkImpExplicit : fails 5 of 5
moveDefBtwMods : fails 6 of 9
addToExport - fails 6 of 8
unfoldAsPatterns : fails 7 of 35
refacRedunDec : fails 7 of 17
pointwiseToPointfree : failed 7 of 7
demote : fails 8 of 16
letToWhere : fails 9 of 15
refacSlicing : fails 10 of 23
liftOneLevel : fails 12 of 14
introNewDef : fails 13 of 15
liftToToplevel : fails 13 of 14
evalMonad : fails 14 of 19
removeField : fails 15 of 17
introCase : fails 22 of 33
subIntroPattern : fails 22 of 25

simplifyExpr : fails 28 of 30

addCon - fails all

evalAddEvalMon : fails : Prelude.read: no parse
evalAddEvalMonCache: fails : Prelude.read: no parse

introThreshold : fails Prelude.read: no parse [problem is UTest.data
   set up for caching test, but script does not call it]

merging : fails Prelude.read: no parse
