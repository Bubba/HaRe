Intention: Make use of existing tools to parse/pretty print, round
   trip haskell code.

Possible tools
  GHC API
  Buildwrapper
  hint
  haskell-src-exts

Probably in combination

Other things to look at
  haskell-mode
  ghc-mod

Buildwrapper is already IDE-aware

Can a lense be used to present the pfe parse tree as if it were the
   GHC one?

From "Technical Report - Porting HaRe to the GHC API":

The porting process was centered on four modules, 
  RefacLocUtils.hs,
  RefacUtils.hs, 
  RefacTypeSyn.hs and 
  RefacUtils.hs


Looks like ifToCase is a really simple start point: but no tests
           refacDataNewType
