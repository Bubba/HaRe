Comparison of the hackage 0.6.0.2 version with this repo

1. editors directory removed

2. misc directory added

3. testing directory (still here :) )

4. Annotated the differences in ./refactorer

5. TODO: check StrategyLib and tools directories

-------------------------

Seems Language.Haskell.Interpreter will return an error if there are any warnings when loading a module.
Will modify tests to avoid warnings, for now, but must address in future.
